What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I can see what files are in the repository and which of these have changed recently.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

I can make logical changes over multiple files, not just one.
I will not make more commits than necessary.


What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

Merging two branches together adopts the individual changes of every branch. 
They have a common history. If one change was to delete some of their common history, this change will not be adopted.
We present it that way, because it shows how they split up, implement their own changes and then merge again.
