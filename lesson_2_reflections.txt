What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

I can see what files are in the repository and which of these have changed recently.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

I can make logical changes over multiple files, not just one.
I will not make more commits than necessary.
